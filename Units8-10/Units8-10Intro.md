# DSA Re-introduction

Welcome to Units 8-10 DSA!

###Goals:

When participating in an interview, developers will be able to:

- Ask clarifying questions
- Identify inputs and outputs
- Give an explanation in words about their approach
- Write code to solve a problem and narrate the process effectively
- Debug code they have written by testing with sample inputs


###Topics:

In Units 4 - 6, you learned the foundational structure of all of the below topics.  In Units 8-10, we will now be practicing applying these skills and how to talk about code.


**Data Structures**

- Arrays
- Hashmaps (Dictionaries)
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Stacks
- Trees
- Graphs

**Algorithms**

- Searching
- Sorting
- Pathfinding
- String + Array manipulation

**Big O Notation**

- Time complexity
- Space complexity

###Class format:

DSA lessons will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays at 11:00 am.

The day before class, I will send out a DSA problem for you all to review that evening.  When class starts, we will review the problem together, focusing on talking through a solution that one student devised previously.

After reviewing the problem as a whole class, the rest of class will be devoted to one of the following activities:

- Pair whiteboarding practice
- Direct instruction reviewing a previously covered DSA topic, or a new topic
- Student modeling an interview question in front of class


###Quick survey

Let's take 5 minutes now to fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/VN8CXgy5SMcU5Htw2) so I can better understand what you are interested in working on.
