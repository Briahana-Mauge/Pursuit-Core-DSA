## Problem Description

A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).

## Sample

Example: 19 is a happy number

1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82

8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68

6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100

1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1
