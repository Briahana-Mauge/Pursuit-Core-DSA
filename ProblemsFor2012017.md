#Problems for 2/01/17

1) https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. 

**Bonus**: The time complexity must be in O(n).

2) Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns whether or not it is a prime number

3) https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.


4) https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/


Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82

82 + 22 = 68

62 + 82 = 100

12 + 02 + 02 = 1


5) https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
