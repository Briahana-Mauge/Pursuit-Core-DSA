Given a fleet of 50 trucks, each with a full fuel tank and a range of 100 miles, how far can you deliver a payload? You can transfer the payload from truck to truck, and you can transfer fuel from truck to truck. Assume all the payload will fit in one truck.

Clarifications:
This does not need a programmatic solution, but is more of a problem-solving puzzle

Hints:
What if we have 1 truck? 2 trucks? Keep going up to the general n-truck case.
